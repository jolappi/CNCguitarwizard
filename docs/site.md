# Web app on GitHub Pages

The `site/` directory is a static web page that runs the real
`cncguitarwizard` package in the browser through
[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) (CPython compiled to WebAssembly). Nothing
runs on a server, so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages as-is, and no code
had to be rewritten for it: the core package is pure, dependency-free
Python.

## What it does

1. Loads Pyodide from the jsDelivr CDN and installs the project wheel from
   `site/wheels/` with micropip.
2. Asks `cncguitarwizard.webapp.parameter_schema()` for every field of
   `Prototype001Parameters` and `MachiningParameters` and draws a grouped
   form from it. Changed values are highlighted; tuple fields are edited as
   JSON.
3. On **Build** calls `cncguitarwizard.webapp.run_build()`, which runs the
   normal `build_prototype001(run_freecad=False)` into Pyodide's in-memory
   file system and returns every artifact as text.
4. Shows the whole-instrument plan view, the three toolpath plots, download
   links for the FreeCAD script (`.py` and `.FCMacro`), the three `.nc`
   programs, the SVG plots and `build.json`, and a summary with stock size
   and time estimates.

FreeCAD cannot run in a browser, so `.FCStd` and STEP are made locally:
download `Prototype001_freecad.py` and run
`freecadcmd Prototype001_freecad.py` (or open the `.FCMacro` in FreeCAD).
The script writes its outputs next to wherever it is executed.

## Building and previewing locally

```bash
python tools/build_site.py
python -m http.server 8765 --directory site
```

Then open <http://localhost:8765>. `tools/build_site.py` builds the wheel
into `site/wheels/` and writes `site/wheel.json`, both git-ignored. The
page needs to be served over HTTP (not opened as a file) because Pyodide
fetches the wheel.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds the wheel and publishes `site/` on
every push to `main`. Enable Pages once in the repository settings
(*Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions*); the workflow's `deploy`
job prints the page URL.
