# Engineering Log

## Core Foundation

The Project object was introduced as the single root object.

Reason:

Future modules should never depend directly on each other.
Instead, every subsystem receives the same Project instance.

### Architecture

Decision:
Core is independent from all CAD backends.

Accepted
